Water pollution is a significant contemporary threat, with drinking water becoming increasingly contaminated. Contaminated water can lead to various diseases in both humans and animals, subsequently impacting the ecosystem's life cycle. Early detection of water pollution allows for timely intervention, preventing critical situations. Unfortunately, many people are unaware of their water usage and tend to waste it. To raise awareness and control water usage, a community-based project was proposed and encourages the practice of conserving rainwater. This proposal introduces a new IoT cloud-based model for continuous observation and regulation of water. The system gathers and updates continuous sensor information to the cloud via an IoT Wi-Fi Module. This invention comprises two input sensors: an Ultrasonic sensor monitors the water quantity in the tank, and a Turbidity sensor checks the water quality in the main tank. This ensures redirecting water flow to the common tank for wastewater usage, while high-quality water is pumped into the home tank. Following the extraction of low-quality water from the main tank, contamination occurs within the tank. To address this issue, an automatic tank cleaning system utilizing tank cleaning powder is employed to maintain the cleanliness of the main tank. A 16x2 LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) used in the project shows water quality and the bill for the water used by each house. Experimental work demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system compared to related efforts.
